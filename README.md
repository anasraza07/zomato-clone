# 🍽️ Restaurant App
A modern Restaurant Listing and Food Ordering App built with React. You can browse restaurants, view their menus, add or remove dishes from your cart, and see your total bill, all with a smooth and responsive design.

## 🧾 Short Description

Users can **search and filter** restaurants easily.
Clicking on any restaurant opens its menu page, where users can:
